# Navidrome Discord Rich Presence (NavRPC) üéß

**NavRPC** is a lightweight, optimized Python script that updates your Discord status to display the song currently playing on your [Navidrome](https://www.navidrome.org/) server. It features an integrated Imgur cache and intelligent image optimization to ensure album art displays correctly on Discord.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Subsonic API Polling:** Connects directly to the Navidrome API to fetch the current track.
* **Intelligent Caching:** Uploads and caches album art (via Imgur) locally.
* **Resource Friendly:** Optimized for low CPU/RAM usage, ideal for running on a server, NAS, or Raspberry Pi.
* **Timestamp Accuracy:** Calculates track start and end times to display the remaining time accurately. Note: Can be inaccurate.
